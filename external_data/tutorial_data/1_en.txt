@Cut Start
 Tutorial
	Welcome to the Tutorial.
	This tutorial explains the operation and basic rules.
 Tutorial
	For now, we will deal the initial hand.
	For the tutorial, you will be dealt one card.

@Cut PlayCard
 Tutorial
	The only operation to progress in this game is to select a hand.
 Tutorial
	Drag a card from your hand and drop it in the center of the screen.
	If the aura color of the card you are dragging changes, you can play.


@Cut CardStats
 Tutorial
	When you play a card, the "Combat" phase will automatically begin.
	At the end of the Combat Phase, the played cards are placed on top of each other in a specific position as "played".
	
 Tutorial
	Basic Card Information
	The three numbers in the upper left corner of the card are the card's "Stats".
 Tutorial
	The top number is "Power",
	Compare your Power with your opponent's Power, and the one with the higher Power wins the battle and the right to attack.
	If they are the same value, they are evenly matched, and neither gets the right to attack.
 Tutorial
	The second number from the top is "Hit",
	Generally speaking, it corresponds to attack power.
	Only if you get the right to attack, you can damage your opponent by the value of "Hit".
 Tutorial
	The third number is "Block," and corresponds to defensive power.
	Regardless of the right to attack, the damage dealt to you will be replaced up to the value of the Block.
 Tutorial
	Let's play the following cards and look at the "Combat Phase" again.

@Cut CardInfo
 Tutorial
	There are "Color" and "Level" as basic information for cards other than their ability values.
 Tutorial
	Color" is represented by the color used for the frame of the card, but other display methods are under consideration.
	There are four types of colors: red, green, blue, and colorless.
 Tutorial
	Color itself has no effect in the basic system. It is used for conditions and targets of skills, etc.
 Tutorial
	Level" is the number in the upper right corner of the card. (but I'm inclined to express it in terms of the number of color icons)
	It represents the amount of energy a card has. The higher it is, the stronger the card is.
 Tutorial
	When you play the next card, you will receive damage and move on to the explanation of "Recovery Phase".

@Cut Damage_Recovery
 Tutorial
	When a player takes damage that cannot be prevented by Block, he/she will enter "Recovery Phase" to neutralize the damage before going to the next Combat Phase.
 Tutorial
	Draw one more card than usual and discard a card from your hand to recover the level of damage. This is repeated until the damage is reduced to 0.
 Tutorial
	You can discard a card from your hand by drag & drop as well as playing.

@Cut DefeatCondition
 Tutorial
	The Defeat Condition is that the player's Life becomes 0 or less.
	And for the "player", Life is the sum of the levels of cards in the deck and in the hand.
 Tutorial
	The "player" can fight until he/she runs out of cards in his/her deck and hand.
	The number of cards in your deck and your Life are shown in the lower right corner (upper left corner for your opponent).
 Tutorial
	Enemies for solo play do not discard their cards even if they are damaged.
 Tutorial
	Life is set as a mere endurance value regardless of the cards in your hand or deck, so try to cut down your opponent's Life before you run out of cards.
 Tutorial
	If you play the next card, your opponent's Life will be reduced to 0 and this tutorial will end.

@Cut End
 Tutorial
	Thank you for your hard work.
